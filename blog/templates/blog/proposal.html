        <h1>My Proposal</h1>

            Ukiyo-e, or pictures of the floating world, was an artform that originated in the Edo Period of Japan (1603-1867) and consisted of woodblock prints. It rose to popularity in the late 1600s from its depictions of the Yoshiwara, the legal prostitution district of Edo, now known as Tokyo. Although the subject of the prints changed over time, within these prints is a reflection of popular cultures values and ideas.

            In my class <em>The Origins of Japanese Manga</em>, we saw how the feminine ideal changed over the centuries from a bold, broad, courtesan to an impossibly thin figure, to an ideal influenced by the onnagata, male actors who play female roles, in kabuki theater. We also saw that in the 19th century there was a shift towards the masculine in the prints as depictions of sumo, warriors, and heroes began to rise. These prints also captured instruments that were relevant at the time and the context in which the instruments were played. For example, we saw many prints of oiran, high class prostitutes, and geisha, accomplished entertainers, in the Yoshiwara playing the shamisen, as a proper courtesan of the time was often educated and adept at an instrument. We also saw depictions of upper class women playing the koto, a string instrument that was common in traditional music like gagaku of the time.

            When taking this class, I was fascinated by the intersection between the arts, specifically theater and music. As we studied ukiyo-e, we saw depictions of kabuki theater, many were advertisements, and depictions of musicians and instruments that were commonplace in the Yoshiwara and kabuki. Kabuki theater is an artform that originated in the early 1600s. It is claimed to have originated with the performer Izumo Shrine who performed suggestive dances and skits in Kyoto. One identifying feature of kabuki is that it is performed by all male actors. This was a result of the government's attempt to separate the profession of acting and the theater district from prostitution and is where the onnagata originated. Ukiyo-e art was often used commercially to advertise for restaurants, brothels, and kabuki performances. Actors would sometimes sponsor prints of themselves to increase their celebrity status.

            While in Japan, I want to visit museums that display ukiyo-e collections to expand on what I learned in class. I loved the prints shown in class, but they were all chosen by my professor and therefore they were chosen to support the story that she has formulated. My hope is that visiting these museums and seeing new prints will give me more freedom to contextualize these prints and conventions that I’ve studied.

            Museums I plan to visit include the Ota Memorial Museum of Art, the Tokyo National Museum, Machida City Museum of Graphic Arts, and the Sumida Hokusai Museum.

            While in Japan, I would like to see kabuki performances. There are two theaters I had in mind, the Kabukiza Theater in Tokyo and the Minamiza theater in Kyoto. Upon researching these performances, I discovered that some kabuki theaters include ukiyo-e art within their programs. I'm curious if I would see more advertisements that incorporate conventions of ukiyo-e in their structure as I walk around Tokyo. The ukiyo-e art is not the only thing about kabuki that draws me to it. Kabuki theater also has a strong connection to music as it has been an essential element in storytelling. The shamisen, which I mentioned earlier was popular in the Yoshiwara, is also a prominent instrument within kabuki music. It is also common for there to be traditional drums like the ko-tsuzumi and the ō-tsuzumi present in kabuki performances. Although some music is performed on stage, there is live music played off stage throughout in the kuromisu, a room on the left of the stage. This music is intended to set the ambiance of the play and includes sounds that evoke feelings of seasons, weather, and other elements of the environment. Seeing a live kabuki performance would be an amazing experience to connect all three of the arts I have been discussing: music, ukiyo-e, and kabuki.

            As we entered the Meiji period of Japan and the shogunate government was overthrown, there was a rapid movement among Japan to modernize and with it came the universal education as it was a way for the new government to effectively communicate with the masses. Within this new school system, rather than teaching traditional Japanese music like gagaku, “imperial court music”, they decided to “modernize” and adopt European music within their education system. It was also a time where western drawing techniques such as foreshortening and one point perspective were becoming prominent in ukiyo-e prints.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the kabuki performances and museums I mentioned earlier, on this trip I am planning to attend local performances in Tokyo and Kyoto with a focus on performances that include the shamisen, koto, or other traditional instruments but also engage with the greater music scene in Tokyo. I'm excited to visit the restaurant Waentei-Kikko where the owner of the restaurant gives a shamisen performance daily and see the Zakuro show, a performance of traditional Japanese instruments where they discuss the context of the piece in English during the performances.
