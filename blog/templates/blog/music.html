        <h1><em>Ukiyo-e</em> and Manga</h1>
        <p>
            <em>Ukiyo-e</em> was one of the first art forms in Japan that was widely accessible to the public. Prints would cost about as much as a bowl of ramen today and were seen as a cheap commodity. Because it became so popular and accessible, <em>ukiyo-e</em> both influenced and reflected the interests of everyday people in Tokyo. It was used to advertise everything from <em>kabuki theater</em> to fabrics. I’m interested in the connection that <em>ukiyo-e</em> had to people of the time, in how it is currently represented in Japan, and how manga, Japanese comic books, and anime relate to <em>ukiyo-e</em> in the current day.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my three weeks in Japan, I visited a variety of museums related to <em>ukiyo-e</em> and manga. Most of the prints that I saw were from the late 18th century and the 19th century and one thing I noticed is that <em>ukiyo-e</em> often included depictions of everyday people, even when the subject of a series was focused on the landscape such as in Hokusai’s work, <em>Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji</em>. This connection to people was one way that <em>ukiyo-e</em> reflected the interests and lives of people at the time.
