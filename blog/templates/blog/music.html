        <h1><em>Ukiyo-e</em> and Manga</h1>
        <p>
            <em>Ukiyo-e</em> was one of the first art forms in Japan that was widely accessible to the public. Prints would cost about as much as a bowl of ramen today and were seen as a cheap commodity. Because it became so popular and accessible, <em>ukiyo-e</em> both influenced and reflected the interests of everyday people in Tokyo. It was used to advertise everything from <em>kabuki theater</em> to fabrics. I’m interested in the connection that <em>ukiyo-e</em> had to people of the time, in how it is currently represented in Japan, and how manga, Japanese comic books, and anime relate to <em>ukiyo-e</em> in the current day.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my three weeks in Japan, I visited a variety of museums related to <em>ukiyo-e</em> and manga. Most of the prints that I saw were from the late 18th century and the 19th century and one thing I noticed is that <em>ukiyo-e</em> often included depictions of everyday people, even when the subject of a series was focused on the landscape such as in Hokusai’s work, <em>Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji</em>. This connection to people was one way that <em>ukiyo-e</em> reflected the interests and lives of people at the time.

                <h1>Music in Japan</h1>
                <p>At Carleton I've been involved with the Chinese Music Ensemble as a composer and a performer. The ensemble along with my ethnomusicology course introduced me to instruments from other countries and made me interested in the diversity of sounds and music out there. Many Japanese traditional instruments actually came to Japan from China in their primitive forms such as the koto and the syakuhati (also written as shakuhachi). To prepare for the trip, I read Bonnie C. Wade's book, Music in Japan. In this book she discusses how Japanese music is difficult to describe for it has been heavily impacted by foreign influences. For example, in the 19th century, western music was introduced to Japan's newly founded public school system while traditional music continued outside of it. This influence of the western world can also be seen in ukiyo-e and manga. Ukiyo-e artists used techniques developed by western artists such as their use of perspective and they also were given chemically based inks in the 19th century that changed the colors they had available to them. Manga was also heavily influenced by outside artists. For example many lines in manga used to convey movement are taken from European and American comics. </p>
                <p>
                  On my trip I went to a variety of festivals and performances to hear as many traditional instruments as I could find while also trying to get a sense of what type of music is popular and commonly played in Japan. As we are in a world massively influenced by globalization it is interesting to see the contrast between musical styles that are preserved because of their cultural importance and the music that is most commonly played in public settings. How does music connect to a cultural identity and in an era of globalization what makes a certain kind of music Japanese?
